In this analysis we seek to find Gene Ontology terms which may be overrepresented in a "target set" of abstracts, such as the results of a PubMed query.

We first fetch all the results of a specific query from Pubmed using the `RISmed` package and store their abstracts in a `data.frame`.

```{R, eval = F}
library(RISmed)

# Store the input string for reuse
search_topic <- "anaphylaxis genetics"
search_query <- EUtilsSummary(search_topic, mindate=2014, maxdate=2015)

summary(search_query)

pull <- EUtilsGet(search_query)

data <- data.frame('Abstracts' = AbstractText(pull))

# Get rid of first entry for some reason, seems to always be blank
data[,1] <- as.character(data[,1])
data <- data[-1,]

head(data)
```

We want to compare the terms found here to something, so we grab all abstracts from 2014 to 2015 which match a similar field, i.e. immunology genetics.  Note that only 1000 records are taken by default.

```{R, eval = F}
# Store the input string for reuse
search_topic <- "immunology genetics"
search_query <- EUtilsSummary(search_topic, # Find all articles matching the string
                              mindate=2014, # From 2014
                              maxdate=2015, # to 2015
                              retmax = 1000)  # This is the default but explicit

summary(search_query)

pull_control <- EUtilsGet(search_query)

control <- data.frame('Abstracts' = AbstractText(pull_control))

# Get rid of first entry for some reason, seems to always be blank
control[,1] <- as.character(control[,1])
control <- control[-1,]

head(control)
```

We now run `mineR` on each of the entries in both the target group and the control group.

```{R, eval = F}
 data(package = "mineR", "TDM.go.df")
  TDM.go.df <- TDM.go.df[, !duplicated(colnames(TDM.go.df))]

  lims <- c(1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,10)

  results <- list()

  for(i in 1:length(data)){

    if(!data[i] == ""){
      results[[i]] <- mineR(doc = data[i],
            terms = terms,
            lims = lims,
            syn = F,
            object = T,
            log = "/dev/null",
            reader = "local",
            output = "/dev/null",
            term_tdm = TDM.go.df)
    }
  }

  results <- do.call("rbind", results)

  control_results <- list()

  for(i in 1:length(control)){
    if(!control[i] == ""){
      control_results[[i]] <- mineR(doc = control[i],
            terms = terms,
            lims = lims,
            syn = F,
            object = T,
            log = "/dev/null",
            reader = "local",
            output = "/dev/null",
            term_tdm = TDM.go.df)
    }
  }
  control_results <- do.call("rbind", control_results)
```

This gives us two objects holding the results, `results` and `control_results`.  We summarize the results and take all the terms in the result set with more than two occurances to minimize spurious hits.

```{R, eval = F}
