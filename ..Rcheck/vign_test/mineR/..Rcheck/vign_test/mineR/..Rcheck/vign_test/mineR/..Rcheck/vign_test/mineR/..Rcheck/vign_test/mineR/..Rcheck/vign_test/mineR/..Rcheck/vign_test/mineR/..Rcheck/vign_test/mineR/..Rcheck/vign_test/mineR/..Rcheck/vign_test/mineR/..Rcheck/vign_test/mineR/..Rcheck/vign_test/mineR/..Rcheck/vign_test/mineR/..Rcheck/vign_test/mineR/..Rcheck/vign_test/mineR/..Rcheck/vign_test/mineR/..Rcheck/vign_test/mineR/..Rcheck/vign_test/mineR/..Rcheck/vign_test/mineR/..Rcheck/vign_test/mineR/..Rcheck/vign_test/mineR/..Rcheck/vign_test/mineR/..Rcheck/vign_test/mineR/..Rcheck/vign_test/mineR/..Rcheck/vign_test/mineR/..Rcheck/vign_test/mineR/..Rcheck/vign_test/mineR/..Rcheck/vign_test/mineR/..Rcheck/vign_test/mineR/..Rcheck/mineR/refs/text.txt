Abstract

Database, Vol. 2014, Article ID bau086

Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is a common task among model organism databases
(MODs) for capturing gene function data from journal articles. It is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive task, and is thus often considered as one of the bottlenecks in literature
curation. There is a growing need for semiautomated or fully automated GO curation
techniques that will help database curators to rapidly and accurately identify gene func-
tion information in full-length articles. Despite multiple attempts in the past, few studies
have proven to be useful with regard to assisting real-world GO curation. The shortage
of sentence-level training data and opportunities for interaction between text-mining
developers and GO curators has limited the advances in algorithm development and
corresponding use in practical circumstances. To this end, we organized a text-mining
challenge task for literature-based GO annotation in BioCreative IV. More speciﬁcally,
we developed two subtasks: (i) to automatically locate text passages that contain GO-
relevant information (a text retrieval task) and (ii) to automatically identify relevant GO
terms for the genes in a given article (a concept-recognition task). With the support from
ﬁve MODs, we provided teams with >4000 unique text passages that served as the basis
for each GO annotation in our task data. Such evidence text information has long been
recognized as critical for text-mining algorithm development but was never made avail-
able because of the high cost of curation. In total, seven teams participated in the chal-
lenge task. From the team results, we conclude that the state of the art in automatically
mining GO terms from literature has improved over the past decade while much pro-
gress is still needed for computer-assisted GO curation. Future work should focus on
addressing remaining technical challenges for improved performance of automatic
GO concept recognition and incorporating practical beneﬁts of text-mining tools into
real-world GO annotation.

Introduction

Manual Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is the task of
human curators assigning gene function information
using GO terms through reading the biomedical litera-
ture, the results of which play important roles in differ-
ent areas of biological research (1–4). Currently, GO
(data-version: 9 September 2013 used in the study) con-
tains >40 000 concept terms (e.g. cell growth) under
three distinct branches (molecular function, cellular com-
ponent and biological process). Furthermore, GO terms
are organized and related in a hierarchical manner (e.g.
cell growth is a child concept of growth), where terms
can have single or multiple parentage (5). Manual GO
annotation is a common task among model organism
databases (MODs) (6) and can be time-consuming and
labor-intensive. Thus, manual GO annotation is often
considered one of the bottlenecks in literature-based bio-
curation (7). As a result, many MODs can only afford to
curate a fraction of relevant articles. For instance, the
curation team of The Arabidopsis Information Resource
(TAIR) has been able to curate <30% of newly

published articles
Arabidopsis genes (8).

Recently, there is a growing interest for building auto-
matic text-mining tools to assist manual biological data
curation (eCuration) (9–20), including systems that aim to
help database curators to rapidly and accurately identify
gene function information in full-length articles (21, 22).
Although automatically mining GO terms from full-text
articles is not a new problem in Biomedical Natural
Language Processing (BioNLP), few studies have proven to
be useful with regard to assisting real-world GO curation.
The lack of access to evidence text associated with GO an-
notations and limited opportunities for interaction with ac-
tual GO curators have been recognized as the major
difficulties in algorithm development and corresponding
application in practical circumstances (22, 23). As such, in
BioCreative IV, not only did we provide teams with article-
level gold-standard GO annotations for each full-text
article as has been done in the past, but we also provided
evidence text for each GO annotation with help from ex-
pert GO curators. That is, to best help text-mining tool

advancement, evidence text passages that support each GO
annotation were provided in addition to the usual GO anno-
tations, which typically include three distinct elements: gene
or gene product, GO term and GO evidence code.

Also, as we know from past BioCreative tasks, recogniz-
ing gene names and experimental codes from full text are
difficult tasks on their own (24–27). Hence, to encourage
teams to focus on GO term extraction, we proposed, for
this task, to separate gene recognition from GO term and
evidence code selection by including both the gene names
and associated NCBI Gene identifiers in the task data sets.
Specifically, we proposed two challenge tasks, aimed to-
ward automated GO concept recognition from full-length
articles:

Task A: retrieving GO evidence text for relevant
genes

GO evidence text is critical for human curators to make
associated GO annotations. For a given GO annotation,
multiple evidence passages may appear in the paper, some
being more specific with experimental information while
others may be more succinct about the gene function. For
this subtask, participants were given as input full-text art-
icles together with relevant gene information. For system
output, teams were asked to submit a list of GO evidence
sentences for each of
the input genes in the paper.
Manually curated GO evidence passages were used as the
gold standard for evaluating team submissions. Each team
was allowed to submit three runs.

Task B: predicting GO terms for relevant genes

This subtask is a step toward the ultimate goal of using com-
puters for assisting human GO curation. As in Task A, par-
ticipants were given as input full-text articles with relevant
gene information. For system output, teams were asked to
return a list of relevant GO terms for each of the input genes
in a paper. Manually curated GO annotations were used as
the gold standard for evaluating team predictions. As in
Task A, each team was allowed to submit three runs.

Generally speaking, the first subtask is a text retrieval
task while the second can be seen as a multi-class text
classification problem where each GO term represents a
distinct class label. In the BioNLP research domain, the
first subtask is in particular akin to the BioCreative II
Interaction Sentence subtask (24), which also served as an
immediate step for the ultimate goal of detecting protein–-
protein interactions. Task A is also similar
to the
BioCreative I GO subtask 2.1 (22) and automatic GeneRIF
identification (18, 28–31). The second subtask is similar to
the BioCreative I GO subtask 2.2 (22) and is also closely

related to the problem of semantic indexing of biomedical
literature, such as automatic indexing of biomedical publi-
cations with MeSH terms (32–35).

Methods

Corpus annotation

A total of eight professional GO curators from five differ-
ent MODs—FlyBase (http://flybase.org/); Maize Genetics
and Genomics Database (http://www.maizegdb.org/); Rat
Genome Database (http://rgd.mcw.edu/); TAIR (http://
www.arabidopsis.org/); WormBase
(http://www.worm-
base.org/)—contributed to the development of the task
data. To create the annotated corpus, each curator was
asked, in addition to their routine annotation of gene-
related GO information, to mark up the associated evi-
dence text in each paper that supports those annotations
using a Web-based annotation tool. To provide complete
data for text-mining system development (i.e. both positive
and negative training data), curators were asked to select
evidence text exhaustively throughout the paper (36).

For obtaining high-quality and consistent annotations
across curators, detailed annotation guidelines were de-
veloped and provided to the curators. In addition, each
curator was asked to practice on a test document following
the guidelines before they began curating task documents.
Because of the significant workload and limited number of
curators per group, each paper was only annotated by a
single curator.

Evaluation measures

For Task A evaluation, traditional precision (P), recall (R)
and F1 score (F1) are reported when comparing the submit-
ted gene-specific sentence list against the gold standard.
We computed the numbers of true-positive (TP) results and
false-positive (FP) results in two ways: the first one (exact
match) is a strict measure that requires the returned sen-
tences exactly match the sentence boundary of human
markups, while the second (overlap) is a more relaxed
measure where a prediction is considered correct (i.e. TP)
as long as the submitted sentence overlaps with the gold
standard. Although a single character overlap between the
text-mined and human-curated sentences would be suffi-
cient for the relaxed measure, the actual overlap is signifi-
cantly higher as we found in practice (see results below).

For the Task B evaluation, gene-specific GO annotations

In addition to the traditional precision, recall and F1 score,
hierarchical Precision (hP), Recall (hR) and F1 score (hF1)
were also computed where common ancestors in both the
computer-predicted and human-annotated GO terms are
considered. The second set of measures was proposed to
reflect the hierarchical nature of GO: a gene annotated
with one GO term is implicitly annotated with all of the
term’s parents, up to the root concept (37, 38). Such a
measure takes into account that ‘predictions that are close
to the oracle label should score better than predictions that
are in an unrelated part of the hierarchy’. (37) Specifically,
the hierarchical measures are computed as follows:

Results

The BC4GO corpus

The task participants were provided with three data sets
comprising 200 full-text articles in the BioC XML format
(39). Our evaluation for the two subtasks was to assess
teams’ ability to return relevant sentences and GO terms
for each given gene in the 50 test articles. Hence, we show
in Table 1 the overall statistics of the BC4GO corpus
including the numbers of genes, gene-associated GO terms
and evidence text passages. For instance, in the 50 test art-
icles, 194 genes were associated with 644 GO terms and
1681 evidence text passages, respectively. We refer inter-
ested readers to (36) for a detailed description of the
BC4GO corpus.

Team participation results

Overall, seven teams (three from America, three from Asia
and one from Europe) participated in the GO task. In total,
they submitted 32 runs: 15 runs from five different teams
for Task A, and 17 runs from six teams for Task B.

Discussion

As mentioned earlier, our task is related to a few previous
challenge tasks on biomedical text retrieval and semantic
indexing. In particular, our task resembles the earlier GO
task in BioCreative I (22). On the other hand, our two sub-
tasks are different from the previous tasks. For the passage
retrieval task, we only provide teams with pairs of <gene,
document> and asked their systems to return relevant evi-
dence text while <gene, document, GO terms> triples
were provided in the earlier task. We provided less in-
put information to teams because we aim to have our
tasks resemble real-world GO annotation more closely,
where the only input to human curators is the set of
documents.

For the GO-term prediction task, we provided teams
with the same <gene, document> pairs and asked their
systems to return relevant GO terms. In addition to such
input pairs, the expected number of GO terms and their
associated GO ontologies (Molecular Function, Biological
Process, and Cellular Component) returned were also pro-
vided in the earlier task. Another difference is that along
with each predicted GO term for the given gene in the
given document, output of associated evidence text is also
required in the earlier task.

The evaluation mechanism also differed in the two chal-
lenge events. We provided the reference data before the
team submission and preformed standard evaluation. By
contrast, in the BioCreative I GO task, no gold-standard
evaluation data were provided before the team submission.
Instead, expert GO curators were asked to manually judge
the team submitted results. Such a post hoc analysis could
miss TP results not returned by teams and would not per-
mit evaluation of new systems after the challenge. While
there exist other metrics for measuring sentence and se-
mantic similarity (31, 40–42), to compare with previous
results, we followed the evaluation measures (e.g. preci-
sion, recall and F1 score) in (22).

Despite these differences, we were intrigued by any po-
tential improvement in the task results due to the advance-
ment of text-mining research in recent years. As the
ultimate goal of the task is to find GO terms, the results of
Task B are of more interest and significance in this aspect,
though evidence sentences are of course important for
reaching this goal. By comparing the team results in the
two challenge events [Table 3 above vs. Table 5 in (22)],
we can observe a general trend of performance increase on
this task over time. For example, the best-performing team
in 2005 (22) was only able to predict 78 TPs (of 1227 in
gold standard)—a recall of <7%—while there are several
teams in our task who obtained recall values between 10
and 30%. The numbers are even greater when measured
by taking account of the hierarchical nature of the Gene
Ontology.

Post-challenge analysis: classification of FP
sentences

To better understand the types of FP sentences returned by
the participating text-mining systems, we asked curators to
manually review and classify FP predictions using one or
more categories described below. For this analysis, each
curator was given three test set papers that they previously
annotated. In total, seven curators completed this analysis
by assigning 2289 classifications to 2074 sentences.

Sentence classifications

(1) Experiment was performed—These types of sentences
relate that an experiment has been performed but do not
describe what the actual result was. Such sentences may or
may not contain a GO-related concept.

‘To characterize the functions and interrelationships of
CSP41a and CSP41b, T-DNA insertion lines for the
genes encoding the two proteins were characterized.’

(2) Previously published result—These sentences refer to
experimental ﬁndings from papers cited in the test set
papers. They often contain a parenthetical reference, or

Page 6 of 14

Database, Vol. 2014, Article ID bau086

other indication, that the information is from a previously
published paper.

‘Molecular studies of the REF-1 family genes hlh-29
and hlh-28 indicate that their gene products are identi-
cal, and that loss of hlh-29/hlh-28 activities affects C.
elegans embryonic viability, egg-laying, and chemore-
pulsive behaviors [21].’

(3) Not GO related—These sentences describe an aspect of
biology that is not amenable to GO curation, i.e. it does
not describe a biological process, molecular function or
cellular component.

‘(A) An anti-Aurora A anti-serum recognizes the NH2-
terminal recombinant histidine-tagged protein domain
used for immunization (left) and the 47-kD endogenous
Aurora A protein kinase in Drosophila embryo extracts
(right) by Western blotting.’

(4) Curator missed—This class of sentences actually repre-
sents TP sentences that the curator failed to identify when
annotating the test set papers.

‘We found that knockdown of Shank3 specifically
impaired mGluR5 signaling at synapses.’

(5) Interpretive statements/author speculation—These sen-
tences describe either an author’s broader interpretation of
an experimental ﬁnding or their speculation on that ﬁnd-
ing, but do not necessarily provide direct evidence for a
GO annotation.

‘The binding site for AR-C155858 involves TMs 7-10
of MCT1, and probably faces the cytosol.’

(6) Contiguous sentence—These sentences were selected by

additional sentences that may or may not be directly adja-
cent to the annotated sentence. In these cases, curators felt
that additional information was needed to completely sup-
port the GO annotation.

would not be annotated for GO.

perimental ﬁnding that does not reﬂect the wild-type activ-
ity of the gene product. This classiﬁcation is distinct from
sentences that describe mutant phenotypes, which are
often used to assign GO Biological Process annotations.

The results of the classification analysis are presented in
Figure 1. These results indicate that the FP sentences cover
a broad range of classifications, but importantly, that only
12% of the FP sentences were classified by curators as
completely unrelated to a GO concept. Many of the FP
sentences thus contain some element of biology that is rele-
vant to GO annotation, but lack the complete triplet, i.e.
an entity, GO term and assay, that is typically required for

supported GO

As an additional part of the sentence classification, we
also asked curators to indicate which, if any, of the GO
triplet was missing from a FP sentence. These analyses indi-
cate some overall trends. For example, many of the sen-
tences that describe previously published results do not
indicate the nature of the assay used to determine the ex-
perimental findings. In contrast, sentences that describe
how or what type of an experiment was performed may in-
clude all aspects of the triplet yet lack the actual experi-
mental result
that supports an annotation. Likewise,
sentences that describe negative results may contain all as-
pects of the triplet, but the prediction methods failed to
discern the lack of association between the gene product
and the GO term.

The results of the sentence classification analysis suggest
that many of the FP sentences returned by the participating
teams have some relevance to GO annotation but either
lack one element of the GO annotation triplet or contain

all elements of a triplet but fail to correctly discern the ac-
tual experimental result. This suggests that further work to
refine how evidence sentences are identified and presented
to curators may help to improve the utility of text mining
for GO annotation. For example, if curation tools can pre-
sent predicted evidence sentences within the context of the
full text of the paper, curators could easily locate those
sentences, such as those presented within Results sections,
that are most
likely to support GO annotations.
Additionally, postprocessing of sentences to remove those
that contain terms such as ‘not’ or ‘no’ may help to elimin-
ate statements of negative results from consideration.

Further analysis of the content of evidence sentences
will hopefully provide valuable feedback to text-mining de-
velopers on how to refine their prediction algorithms to
improve precision of evidence sentence identification. For
example, within a sampling of the largest sentence classifi-
cation category,
‘Experiment was Performed’, curators
marked nearly half of the sentences as containing no GO
term. Systematic comparison of
these sentences with

Page 8 of 14

Database, Vol. 2014, Article ID bau086

similarly categorized sentences that did contain a GO term
concept may help to improve techniques for GO term
recognition.

Additional follow-up analysis may also help annotation
groups consider new ways in which to use text-mining re-
sults. Text mining for GO annotation might thus expand
to include not only predictions for experimentally sup-
ported annotations but also predictions for other annota-
tions supported by the text of a paper such as those
described from previously published results. GO annota-
tion practice includes an evidence code, Trace-able Author
Statement (TAS), that can be used for these types of anno-
tations, so perhaps a new evidence code that indicates a
TAS annotation derived from text mining could be de-
veloped for such cases.

Individual system descriptions

Each team has agreed to contribute a brief summary of the
most notable aspects of their system. In summary, the ma-
chine learning approaches performed better than the rule-
based approaches in Task A. For example, Team 238
achieved the best performance by using multiple features
(bag-of-words, bigram features, section features, topic fea-
tures, presence of genes) and training a logistic regression
model to classify positive vs negative instances of GO evi-
dence sentences.

A variety of methods were attempted for Task B, such
as K-nearest-neighbor, pattern matching and information
retrieval (IR)-based ranking techniques. Moreover, several
participants (Team 183, 238 and 250) used the evidence
sentences they retrieved in Task A as input for finding GO
terms in Task B. The best performance in Task B was ob-
tained by Team 183’s supervised categorization method,
which retrieved most prevalent GO terms among the k
most similar instances to the input text in their knowledge
base (43).

from being useful

The BiTeM/SIBtex group participated in the
first
BioCreative campaign (22). We then obtained top competi-
tive results, although for all competing systems, perform-
ances were far
the curation
community. At this time, we extracted GO terms from full
texts with a locally developed dictionary-based classifier
(44). Dictionary-based categorization approaches attempt
to exploit lexical similarities between GO terms (descrip-
tions and synonyms) and the input text to be categorized.
Such approaches are limited by the complex nature of
the GO terms. Identifying GO terms in text is highly

for

challenging, as they often do not appear literally or ap-
proximately in text. We have recently reported on GOCat
(45, 46), our new machine learning GO classifier. GOCat
exploits similarities between an input text and already
curated instances contained in a knowledge base to infer a
functional profile. GO annotations (GOA) and MEDLINE
make it possible to exploit a growing amount of almost
100 000 curated abstracts for populating this knowledge
base. Moreover, we showed in (46) that the quality of the
GO terms predicted by GOCat continues to improve
across the time, thanks to the growing number of high-
quality GO terms assignments available in GOA: thus,
since 2006, GOCat performances have improved by
þ50%.

The BioCreative IV Track 4 gave us the opportunity to
exploit the GOCat power in a reference challenge. For
Task A, we designed a robust state-of-the-art approach,
using a naı¨ve Bayes classifier, the official training set and
words as features. This approach generally obtained fair
results (top performances for high precision systems) and
should still benefit from being tuned for this task with the
new available benchmark. We also investigated exploiting
GeneRIFs for an alternative 40 times bigger training set,
but the results were disappointing, probably because of the
lack of good-quality negative instances. Then, for Task B,
we applied GOCat to the first subtask output and pro-
duced three different runs with five, ten or twenty pro-
posed GO terms. These
runs outperformed other
competing systems both in terms of precision and recall,
with performances up to 0.65 for recall with hierarchical
metrics. Thanks to BioCreative, we were able to design a
complete workflow for curation. Given a gene name and a
full text, this system is able to deliver highly relevant GO
terms along with a set of evidence sentences. Today, the
categorization effectiveness of the tool seems sufficient for
being used in real semiautomatic curation workflows, as
well as in fully automatic workflow for nonmanually cura-
ted biological databases. In particular, GOCat is used to
profile PubChem bioassays (47), and by the COMBREX
project to normalize functions described in free text for-
mats (48).

Team 220: Anh Tuan Luu, Jung-jae Kim (Task B)

Luu and Kim (49) present a method that is based on the
cross products database (50) and combined with a state-
of-the-art statistical method based on the bag of words
model. They call the GO concepts that are not defined
with cross products, ‘primitive concepts’, where the primi-
tive concepts of a GO term are those that are related to the
GO term through cross products possibly in an indirect
manner. They assume, like the assumption of bag-of-words

Database, Vol. 2014, Article ID bau086

Page 9 of 14

approach, that if all or most of the primitive concepts of a
GO term appear in a small window of text (e.g. sentence),
the GO term is likely to be expressed therein. For each GO
term and a text, the method first collects all primitive con-
cepts of the GO term and identifies any expression of a
primitive concept in the text. It recognizes as expressions
of a primitive concept the words that appear frequently in
the documents that are known to express the concept
(called domain corpus), but not frequently in a representa-
tive subset of all documents (called generic corpus). Given
a document d and a primitive concept c, if the sum of the
relative frequency values of the top-K words of the concept
found in the text is larger than a threshold h, we regard the
concept as expressed in the document. Finally, a text is
considered to express GO term C whose cross products
definition has n primitive concepts, if this text expresses at
least k primitive concepts among the n concepts, where the
value of k is dynamically determined using a sigmoid func-
tion, depending on n.

Furthermore, the cross products–based method (called XP
method) is incorporated with Gaudan’s method (51), which
shows a better coverage than the XP method, as follows: For
each GO term C whose cross products definition has n primi-
tive concepts, if the XP method can find evidence to k primi-
tive concepts (as explained above) in the text zone d, the
combined method calculates the sum of the scores from the
two methods. If the sum is greater than a threshold, we as-
sume that d expresses C. If a GO term does not have a cross
products definition, we only use the score of the Gaudan’s
method. In short, we call the combination method is XP-
Gaudan method. The experiment results show that the
F-measures of the two individual methods are lower than
that of the XP-Gaudan method. The recall of the XP-Gaudan
method (21%) is close to the sum of the recall values of the
two individual methods (26%), which may mean that the
two methods target different sets of GO term occurrences. In
other words, the XP method is complementary to the
Gaudan’s method in detecting GO terms in text documents.

Team 237: Jung-Hsien Chiang, Yu-De Chen,
Chia-Jung Yang (Task A, Task B)

We developed two different methods: a sequential pattern
mining algorithm and GREPC (Geneontology concept
Recognition by Entity, Pattern and Constrain)
for the
BioCreative GO track to recognize sentences and GO terms.
In our sequential pattern mining algorithm, the high-
light of this method is that it can infer GO term and which
gene(s) products the GO term belongs to simultaneously.
In this method, each of the generated rules has two classes,
one for the inferred GO term and another for the GO term
to which the gene(s) products belong to. Besides, each of

the rules is learned from data without human intervention.
The basic idea of the sequential pattern mining algorithm
we used was similar to (52–55). We also used Support and
Confidence in association rule learning to measure the
rules generated. In this work, the items were terms that ap-
peared in sentences. The different permutations of terms
will be considered different patterns because of the spirit of
sequential pattern. In the preprocessing, we removed stop
words, stemmed the rest and added P.O.S. tagger to each
term. Then, we anonymized each of the gene(s) products
for generating rules that can be widely used in the situation
with different gene product names. For instance, a sentence
‘In vitro, CSC-1 binds directly to BIR-1’ would become
‘vitro_NN __PROTEIN_0__
bind_VBZ directli_RB
__PROTEIN_1__ ’. Both the terms ‘__PROTEIN_0__’
and ‘__PROTEIN_1__’ are anonymized gene(s) products.
After preprocessing, we thereafter generated rules from the
preprocessed sentences. In the instance we mentioned
above, we can generate some rules, e.g. ‘__PROTEIN_0__
bind_VBZ __PROTEIN_1__ ¼> GO:
0005515,
__PROTEIN_0_’
‘__PROTEIN_0__
bind_VBZ
__PROTEIN_1__ ¼> GO: 0005515, __PROTEIN_1__’,
where the part before the symbol ‘¼>’ is the pattern and
after the symbol are the classes. The first class GO:
0005515 is the GO ID. The second class represents the GO
term belonging to which anonymized gene(s) products.
After all rules have been generated, we used those rules to
classify sentences in the testing data.

and

In the GREPC, we indexed the GO concepts based on
three divisions: entity, pattern and constrain. We gathered
these kinds of information by text mining inside the GO
database (56). Within that, we reconstructed the semi-
structured name and synonyms for a GO concept into a
better-structured synonym matrix. With GREPC, we can
find GO terms in a sentence with a higher recall without
losing much of the precision.

Task B)

For Task A, the Mayo Clinic system effectively leveraged
the learning from positive and unlabeled data approach
(57, 58) to mitigate the constraint of having limited train-
ing data. In addition, the system explored multiple features
(e.g. unigrams, bigrams, section type, topic, gene presence,
etc.) via a logistic regression model to identify GO evidence
sentences. The adopted features in their system brought in-
cremental performance gains, which could be informative
to the future design of similar classification systems. Their
best performing system achieved 0.27 on exact-F1 and
0.387 for overlap-F1, the highest among all participating
systems.

Page 10 of 14

For Task B, the Mayo Clinic team designed two differ-
ent types of systems: (i) the search-based system predicted
GO terms based on existing annotations for GO evidences
that are of different textual granularities (i.e. full-text art-
icles, abstracts and sentences) and are obtained by using
state-of-the-art IR techniques [i.e. a novel application of
the idea of distant supervision in information extraction
(59)]; (ii) the similarity-based systems assigned GO terms
based on the distance between words in sentences and GO
terms/synonyms. While the search-based system signifi-
cantly outperformed the similarity-based system, a more
important finding was that the number and the quality of
GO evidence sentences used in the distance supervision
largely dictates the effectiveness of distant supervision,
meaning a large collection of well-annotated, sentence or
paragraph level GO evidences is strongly favored by sys-
tems using similar approaches.

Team 243: Ehsan Emadzadeh, Graciela Gonzalez
(Task B)

The proposed open-IE approach is based on distributional se-
mantic similarity over the Gene Ontology terms. The tech-
nique does not require the annotated data for training, which
makes it highly generalizable. Our method finds the related
gene functions in a sentence based on semantic similarity of
the sentence to GO terms. We use the semantic vectors pack-
age (60) implementation of latent semantic analysis (LSA)
(61) with random indexing (62) to calculate semantic similar-
ities. GO terms’ semantic vectors are created based on the
names of the entries in GO; one semantic vector is created for
each term in the ontology. Stop words are removed from GO
name, and they are generalized by Porter stemming (63).

After creating the GO semantic vectors, the question is
to find whether a sentence is related to a gene. We do this
by using lexical patterns and generalizing the sentence and
the gene symbol (e.g. removing the numbers and nonalpha-
betic characters). If lexical patterns imply that a sentence is
related to a gene, then we calculate semantic similarity of
the sentence to all GO terms using the generated semantic
vectors. The predicted GO terms for the sentence and the
gene are the conjunction of top similar GO terms to the
sentence (set G) and top similar GO terms to the related
abstract (set D):

GeneGOðgene; sentence; abstractÞ

¼ fGðsentenceÞ \ DðabstractÞg

if HasGeneðsentence; geneÞ elsefg

annotation for each gene in the sentence. For example, if a
sentence top m(¼2) similar GO terms are {g5, g10} and the
abstract top n(¼5) GO terms are {g4, g8, g5, g2, g9}, then
the final predicted GO terms for the sentence related to the
gene will be {g5}. m and n are tuning parameters that con-
trol the precision and the recall. We found that the first
sentences of the paragraphs are the most important sen-
tences in terms of information about gene functions, and
including all sentences in a paragraph significantly reduced
the precision.

Team 250: Yanpeng Li, Hong Yu (Task A, Task B)

For Task A, we built a binary classifier to identify evidence
sentences using reference distance estimator (RDE) (64,
65), a recently proposed semi-supervised learning method
that learns new features from around 10 million unlabeled
sentences. Different from traditional methods for text clas-
sification e.g. bag-of-words features with support vector
machine (SVM) or logistic regression, our method gener-
ates new features using the co-occurrence of existing fea-
tures in big unlabeled data, thus incorporating richer
information to overcome data sparseness and leading to
more robust performance. RDE is a simple linear classifier
in the form of:

X

fðxi; rÞ ¼

ðPðrjjÞ   PðrÞÞxij

(1)

j

where xi is the ith example represented by a Boolean vector
of xij, j is the index of feature, and r is called a reference
feature. The probability of PðrjjÞ   PðrÞ can be directly
estimated from unlabeled data. In the work (64), we
showed in theory and experiment that if r is discriminative
to the class label and highly independent with other fea-
tures, the performance of RDE tends to be close to a classi-
fier trained with infinite labeled data. In our submitted
runs, we applied the Algorithm 2.2 presented in the paper
(64), which generates new features from multiple RDEs
and integrates them in a logistic regression model. For this
task, we selected 110 reference features for semi-supervised
RDE based on the labeled (training and development sets)
and unlabeled data, and then used the output scores of the
110 RDEs leaned from unlabeled data as features (66).
Our best submitted run using only bag-of-words features
achieved an F-score of 19.3% in exact match and 32.5%
in relaxed match, which ranked second place by teams. It
is also promising to see that in both development and test
sets RDE achieved much better F score and area under
curve than SVM and logistic regression (64, 66).

A GO term with the highest semantic similarity to
the sentence in GeneGO set will be chosen as the final GO

In Task B, we developed an IR-based method to retrieve
the GO term most relevant to each evidence sentence using

Database, Vol. 2014, Article ID bau086

Page 11 of 14

a ranking function that combined cosine similarity and the
frequency of GO terms in documents. The ranking func-
tion is defined as follows:
GORankðsentence; GO termÞ
p
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
# of words in sentence

¼ # of Common words in sentence and GO term
# of words in GO term

p

(2)

where the first part is the cosine similarity of the sentence
and GO term, and countðGO termÞ is the number of docu-
ments related to the GO term in the Gene Ontology
Annotation (GOA) databases. Similar to the idea of page
rank algorithm in Web search, the GORank function pre-
fers ‘important’ (high-frequency) GO terms, as we found
that the occurrence of GO term in documents follows a
power law distribution, that is, a small fraction of GO
terms appear in a lot of documents, and most GO terms
appear rarely. In addition, in order to make use of the in-
formation in the annotated sentences to improve the per-
formance, after the ranking, we built a classifier for 12
high-level GO classes trained on labeled sentences to prune
the result. A filtering threshold t was defined as the number
of t most relevant high-level GO classes to the sentence
determined by the classifiers. If the highest ranked GO
term by GORank is in the t classes, it will be selected as a
positive result. The result of submitted runs showed that
the F score increased from 3.6 to 7.8% using these two
strategies (66). Our submission as well as post-submission
results showed these novel methods were able to achieve
the F scores competitive to the top-ranked systems.

Team 264: Jian-Ming Chen, Hong-Jie Dai (Task A)

To efficiently and precisely retrieve GO information from
large amount of biomedical resources, we propose a GO evi-
dence sentence retrieval system conducted via combinatorial
applications of semantic class and rule patterns to automat-
ically retrieve GO evidence sentences with specific gene
mentions from full-length articles. In our approach, the task
is divided into two subtasks: (i) candidate GO sentence re-
trieval, which selects the candidate GO sentences from a
given full text, and (ii) gene entity assignment, which assigns
relevant gene mentions to a GO evidence sentence.

In this study, sentences containing gene entities or GO
terms are considered as potential evidence sentences.
Semantic classes including the adopted and rejected class
derived from the training set using semantic-orientation
point-wise mutual information (SO-PMI) are used for se-
lecting potential sentences and filtering out FP sentences
(67). To further maximize the performance of GO evidence

sentence retrieval, rule patterns generated by domain ex-
perts are defined and applied. For example, if a potential
sentence matches the rule pattern ‘[GENE].* lead to
.*[GO]’, the sentence is selected again as a GO evidence
sentence candidate. After generating the sentence candi-
dates, the process of gene entity assignment is performed
to identify probable gene mentions contained within each
sentence. In our current implementation, a gene is assigned
to the sentence S if the gene is mentioned in S. Otherwise,
we identify the gene with the maximum occurrence from
retrieved sentences in paragraph P in which S belongs, and
assign this gene to sentence S. Alternatively, gene with the
maximum occurrence from retrieved sentences in article A
is verified and assigned to sentence S.

The performance of our GO evidence sentence retrieval
system achieves the highest recall of 0.424 and 0.716 in the
exact match and relaxed overlap measure, respectively.
However, the inadequate F score of our system suggests
that the rule patterns used may decrease the system per-
formance. In the future, the conduction of rule selection in
rule pattern generation and co-reference resolution in gene
entity assignment will be performed to maximize the over-
all performance.

Conclusions

Based on the comparison of team performance in two
BioCreative GO tasks (see details in Discussion), we con-
clude that the state of the art in automatically mining GO
terms from literature has improved over the past decade,
and that computer results are getting closer to human per-
formance. But to facilitate real-world GO curation, much
progress is still needed to address the remaining technical
challenges: First, the number of GO terms (class labels for
classification) is extremely large and continues to grow.
Second, GO terms (and associated synonyms) are designed
for unifying gene function annotations rather than for text
mining, and are therefore rarely found verbatim in the art-
icle. For example, our analysis shows that only about 1/3
of the annotated GO terms in our corpus can be found
using exact matches in their corresponding articles. On the
other hand, not every match related to a GO concept is
annotated. Instead, only those GO terms that represent ex-
perimental findings in a given full-text paper are selected.
Hence, automatic methods must be able to filter irrelevant
mentions that share names with GO terms (e.g. the GO
term ‘growth’ is a common word in articles, but additional
contextual information would be required to determine if
this relatively high-level term should be used for GO anno-
tation purposes). Although a paper’s title can be very use-
ful in deciding whether it is relevant to a GO concept, any
annotations should be attributed to the paper itself rather

Page 12 of 14

data

than its citation. Therefore, excluding the reference section
may be a simple suggestion for making these methods
more relevant to real-life curation. Finally, human annota-
tion
statistical/machine-learning
approaches is still lacking. Despite our best efforts, we are
only able to include 200 annotated articles in our corpus,
which contains evidence text for only 1311 unique gene-
GO term combinations.

for

Our challenge task was inspired and developed in re-
sponse to the actual needs of GO manual annotation.
However, compared with real-world GO annotation, the
BioCreative challenge task is simplified in two aspects: (i)
gene information is provided to the teams while in reality
they are unknown; and (ii) extraction of GO evidence code
information is not required for our task while it is an essen-
tial part of GO annotation in practice. Further investiga-
tion of automatic extraction of gene and evidence code
information and their impact in detecting the correspond-
ing GO terms remains as future work.
