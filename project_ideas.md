## Project Ideas

This is a list of some extensions and/or ideas for projects that could (maybe) be done using this package. It's mostly come about through conversation with others. If you would like to pursue any of these topics, get in touch with either myself or the person who suggested the research topic to figure out details. 

### Electronic Annotation of GO Terms

**Project aim:** Use `goldi` to annotate literature electronically.

**Issues:** 

- Would need to colocate genes with terms
- Maybe could use `goldi` first, then use a secondary program to mine the "context" of the terms.

### Integration with [Planteome](http://planteome.org)

See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/51n8h7/r_package_for_identifying_gene_ontology_terms_in/d7ejs2p) for full conversation. Briefly, `goldi` could be extended to be used with the Plant Ontology. 

- Could precompute the TDM of a specific Ontology and include it in the pacakge.
- See issue [#28](https://github.com/Chris1221/goldi/issues/28)

### GO Slim Sets
